Personal portfolio website

## Overview
My portfolio will be a collection of traditional and digital art created by me, on a website coded and designed by me. It's a project I started in early 2019, and came back to in early 2020 after completing a coding bootcamp. A portfolio, like a resume, is ever changing and I will try to update it every so often.
I decided to make this portfolio because as a long time artist and graphic designer, I always had to depend on other resources to showcase my work, like Instagram for social media or Behance for a website that people can check. Having my own website to show case my portfolio and skills is like a one-stop-shop for all of my creations.
## Features
* **About Me** There is an *About Me* section that will give a bit of my background and has a profile image of me, which I will try to keep updated.
* **Portfolio** The *Portfolio* section will have different links to different styles of work that the user can click to and see images with a description below. These will get updated as new and better content is made.
* **Contact** Users will be able to *Contact* me using a simple Google form that I created by filling it out and submitting. I have the form saving the information currently as a spreadsheet, since there won't be a back-end and database attached to the current version.
